### Overview

In this project, I worked on a problem that is similar but more difficult than the classif Digit Classification Problem (MNIST). In the notebook, I play around with the LeNet architecture and adapt it to the problem. I experiment with several strategies for both speeding up training and controlling model complexity. I achieve above 99.5% validation error.
